            <h2>Classic Yellow Cake with chocolate frosting</h2>
            <p>This fluffy vanilla cake recipe is the absolute best yellow cake from scratch and paired with the silky smooth chocolate frosting, you can't beat it for a classic birthday cake or any other celebration! </p>
            <img src="images/images/yellow-cake-chocolate-frosting-1.jpg" alt="Yellow Cake Chocolate Frosting 1">
            <p>Are you a box mix yellow cake person? Or a from-scratch yellow cake person?</p>
            <p>Truth be told, it's REALLY hard to replicate that always-moist-and-fluffy-texture that everyone loves about a box cake mix, but at the same time, we also love the homemade, right?!</p>
            <p>It took me a long time to find a homemade yellow cake that I really, really love. Box cakes mixes seem to always bake up perfectly fluffy and moist yellow cakes, and the one I've had from bakeries have
                <br/>been great as well, but I just couldn't seem to replicate it at home no matter how many recipes I tried. (Consequently, I haven't had the same issue with chocolate cakes! See: Snicker-Cake - the base recipe for
                <br/>all of my chocolate cakes!).</p>
            <p>Many were too dense, to dry, too chiffon-like, too fussy in their preparation. I just wanted a fantastic yellow cake recipe I could use for birthday cakes that was easy to make and turned out delicious. I came
                <br/>across this recipe from Joy while I was on the hunt for yet another recipe to test cut for Joseph's birthday.</p>
            <p>This was IT. The recipe that had eluded me for years!</p>
            <img src="images/images/yellow-cake-chocolate-frosting-2.jpg" alt="Yellow Cake Chocolate Frosting 2">
            <p>I love that this can easily be mixed together in on bowl using my hand mixer; there's nothing fussy about the ingredients or preparation, and it produces an absolutely perfect yellow cake. The layers are light
                <br/>but sturdy, buttery and moist, and the ideal for your very favorite chocolate frosting.</p>
            <p>I used my chocolate frosting recipe from my ultimate chocolate cupcakes, and it was a wonderful companion to this cake. The frosting is more buttery than sugary, satiny smooth and full of rich chocolate flavour.
                <br/>It glides on like a dream!</p>
            <img src="images/images/yellow-cake-chocolate-frosting-3.jpg" alt="Yellow Cake Chocolate Frosting 3">
            <p>Yellow cake tends to be the elusive unicorn of homemade baking; so many cakes can turn out too dry, too crumbly, too dense, too cornbread-like, and I have one major piece of advice for ensuring yellow cakes
                <br/>perfection: </p>
            <h4>Make sure all of the ingredients listed "at room temperatured" ARE ACTUALLY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.</h4>
            <p>I've totally been there and have used stll-cool butter, eggs or dairy in a recipe when I'm in a hungry, but it's actually vitally important here. Having all of those ingredients at room temperature ensures that they
                <br/> emulsify, which traps air in the batter and, once in the oven, theat air expands and produces a fluffy cake.</p>
            <p>Room temperature ingredients also ensure that the batter comes together well and is ultra-smooth, which keeps the resulting cake from being crumbly or cornbread-like.</p>
